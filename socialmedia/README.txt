-----I am very thankful for this wonderful oppurtunity----

I have built a simple and light socialmedia website that has easy to understand front_end and easy to devolop back_end. 

this was a wonderfull journey for me because I got to learn a lot of new django methods. Hope you have a good time going through the project
